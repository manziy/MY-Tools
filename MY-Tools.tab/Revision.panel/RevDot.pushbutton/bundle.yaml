title: Rev Dots
tooltip: |
  Updates the Sheet Index: adds one column per revision and places a centered ●
  on sheets that include that revision. Safe to re-run. Keeps empty columns.
  Removes columns for revisions deleted from Sheet Issues/Revisions.

  Show linked-model revision dots in the main model’s Sheet Index

  Match revisions first
  In the linked model, go to Sheet Issues/Revisions and make sure the sequence order
  and each Revision Number exactly match the main model (and that the numbering method—Per Project vs Per Sheet—matches).

  Run the same tool in both files
  Open the linked model and run the Revision Dot script/button.
  Then open the main model and run the same script.

  If a dot is missing, re-check the sequence/number alignment and re-run the tool
  in the linked model, then in the main model. Repeat anytime you add/renumber revisions.
