CompanyTools – Revision Dot Add-on

This pyRevit extension adds a custom button to automate revision tracking in the sheet index.
Instead of manually marking which sheets are part of a revision set, the tool generates generic revision dots in the sheet index for you.

Dots are generated the same way across the entire project for clean, professional output.
